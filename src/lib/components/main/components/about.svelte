			Since beginning my journey as a software engineer 8 years ago, I've done remote and on-site
			work for agencies, startups, big and small businesses and collaborated with talented people to
			create digital products for both business and consumer use. I'm quietly confident, naturally
			curious, and perpetually working on improving my craft.
