		<p>
			As a person, I'm always happy to share my experience and help people solve puzzles. I'm a geek
			with a passion for code. Currently I am obsessed with GameDev and GoLang, so if you can't find
			me, I'm probably digging through some forums, most likely trying to figure out an issue with
			the project.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a matter of fact, this very website was my experiment with SvelteKit. I wanted to
			familiarize myself with the library, and decided to treat myself to a personal website. You
			can find the source code of this project <a href="https://github.com">
				On my
				<div class="github-icon">
					<img src={githubIcon} alt="Github icon" />
				</div>
				account:

			Also checkout my <a href="https://medium.com/@levonasatryan28">Medium</a> profile, where I'm logging
			the development of my game :)
