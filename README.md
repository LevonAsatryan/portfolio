# This a portfolio project by Levon Asatryan for anyone who wants to use the portfolio project.

I wanted to add a licence file here, but I think I'll just write it down in my own words that
anyone is free to use this source code as they see fit. You can clone, fork, completely copy and show this as your own, whichever works for you.

# The project is written in Svelte

This was part of my learning process of Svelte. I was having fun creating a portfolio, but at this point it's 2 am and I wanna sleep.

# Installation.

1. clone
2. npm install (make sure to have npm version > 18).
3. npm run dev.
